# Wanna Fortune Teller - aka  "Quantum Lottery Experiment"

![logo](./asset/logo.png)

## Introduction

Greetings, earthlings! Have you ever pondered upon the possibility of harnessing the power of quantum mechanics to predict the lucky numbers for the lottery? While it may sound like a far-fetched idea, I assure you, it is not. With the rapid advancements in quantum technology, this dream could very well become a reality.

In this project, I present to you a humble demonstration of how quantum computers can be utilized to generate random numbers. Utilizing the might of IBM Quantum Lab and the open-source framework, Qiskit, I have constructed a simple quantum circuit that simulates the generation of random numbers.

### Cultural Background

This project was inspired by a figure that has become a part of Italian popular folklore - Signora Wanna. For those unfamiliar, Signora Wanna was a gifted television salesperson who graced the screens from the 70s to the early 2000s. During the twilight years of her career, she gained notoriety for selling "lucky numbers" to play on the national lottery. This, combined with other misdeeds, led to her eventual arrest and conviction. If you're curious to know more, you may seek information on the internet or through the vast knowledge database of Wikipedia.

### The Code

The code comprises of a quantum register consisting of 6 qubits and a classical register consisting of 6 bits. The magic lies in the utilization of the Hadamard gate, which maps the qubits to a superposition of 0 and 1, effectively generating a random number.

Once the circuit has been executed, the results are extracted and mapped to a range of numbers between 1 and 90, which can be used as lottery numbers. The code then selects 6 unique numbers from this range and displays them as the final output.

### The Experiment

It is imperative to note that this experiment is not to be taken seriously and is merely a demonstration of the concept of using quantum computers to generate random numbers. The accuracy of the numbers generated by this code in predicting the actual lottery numbers is purely coincidental.

However, it can still be an entertaining exercise to see how close the numbers generated by this code come to the actual lottery numbers. It serves as an excellent educational tool for those who seek to expand their understanding of quantum computing and its numerous potential applications.

In conclusion, while this experiment may not lead to striking it rich in the lottery, it provides a tantalizing glimpse into the world of quantum computing and the boundless possibilities it holds for the future.

### Conclusion

While this project was created with the intention of being lighthearted and entertaining, it is worth mentioning that if anyone were to use this code to win a lottery prize, **it would be a gracious act to donate a portion of the winnings to a this project**.
