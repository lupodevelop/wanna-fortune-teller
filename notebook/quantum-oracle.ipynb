    "This code is a simulation of a quantum random number generator using the Hadamard gate. The code uses the Qiskit library, which is an open-source framework for developing quantum algorithms and executing them on quantum computers and simulators. In this example, a quantum circuit is created using a Quantum Register of 6 qubits and a Classical Register of 6 bits. The Hadamard gate is applied to each qubit, followed by a measurement operation, to extract random numbers from the quantum system. The simulation is run on the IBM Quantum Lab, which is a cloud-based platform for accessing IBM's quantum computers and simulators. The results of the simulation are then used to extract 6 unique, randomly selected numbers from a list of possible numbers. This code serves as an example of how quantum computing can be used to generate random numbers, which have applications in cryptography, simulations, and other fields."
